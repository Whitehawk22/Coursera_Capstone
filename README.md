Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of yourchoice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. 

## 1) Introduction/Buisness Problem

The purpose of this study is to help a restaurant owner in planning to open a new restaurant in Lynchburg, VA to choose the best location to have a steady flow of customers and increase profit for the buisness. We will also observe competitors in the area and locate the best area to win over those customers.

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

To provide the necessary information for the buisness owner I'm combining Lynhcburg's Census that contains population, average income per neighborhood along with Lynchburg's shapefile and Foursquare API to collect information on competitors in the same negihborhood. 

Lynchburg's Census data is publicly avaiable at this website: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/lynchburgcityvirginiacounty

Lynchburg's Neighborhood's shapefile is publickly avaible at this website: https://www.lynchburgva.gov/available-data-formats

## 3) Methodology

For this report I used a few different maps that could help a buisness owner in deciding the best negiborhood to open a restaurant in Lynchburg based on several variables. I used the Census information combined with various maps using Foursquare API that allowed me to display the wealthier parts of the neightborhood and pinpoint a good location for a new restaurant. 

## 4) Results

Loooking at the results we can see how the majority of the restaurants are group on central streets and also located cloesly near Liberty University. Some of the more wealthy neighborhoods are scattered around. n general, Lynchburg is not a very wealthy city so the majority of the population would not prefer fancy and expensive restaurants. 

## 5) Discussion

When I began doing this study I was expecting most all of the restuarants to be located simply around Liberty University. My results didn't seem to meet that conclusion. 

## 6) Conclusion

This report could be helpful for a restaurant owner who would like to open up a restaurant that offers cheap yet good food while also providing a aesthetic that could work for both college aged students as well as families with younger children. The location would need to be easily accesible to those who travel by bus as well as college stuents who would not like to travel far off of liberty campus.
